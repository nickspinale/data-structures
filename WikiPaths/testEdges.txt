# The test list of articles
# These are placeholder names, only for testing PathFinder

# The graph that this file generates consists of:
#   A one-way, infinite cycle from A through E
#   An edge (effectively a shortcut) from A to E
#   A two-way edge between F and G
#   No connections between H and anything else

# Important cases to look out for:
#   A -> E should not go take the 'shortcut'
#   H <-> x shound not exist for any x != H
#   {F, G} <-> {A - E} shoud not exist

# Some lengths (to fulfill the assignment's requirement)"
#   A -> E = 1
#   A -> D = 3
#   B -> A = 4
#   B -> H = NA
