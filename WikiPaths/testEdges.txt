# The graph that this file generates consists of:
#   A one-way, infinite cycle from A through E
#   An edge (effectively a shortcut) from A to E
#   A two-way edge between F and G
#   No connections between H and anything else

# Important cases to look out for:
#   A -> E
#   H <-> x
#   {F, G} <-> {A - E}
